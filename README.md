# ü™≤ **CicadaMap** - Blockchain Risk Detection & Scam Monitoring

## üåê **Overview**

**CicadaMap** is an advanced, real-time **blockchain risk analysis tool** designed to detect scams, suspicious wallet behavior, and market manipulation patterns. Powered by **AI**, **CicadaMap** continuously monitors blockchain activity, tracks wallet connections, and visualizes risks, keeping you secure in the decentralized world.

## üöÄ **Features:**

- **üîç Real-Time Scam Detection**: Automatically scans transactions and patterns to detect potential scams. Uses detection to flag unusual wallet behaviors, such as sudden large transfers or unusual transaction patterns.

  ```javascript
  function detectScam(transactionData) {
    const anomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(transactionData);
    if (anomalyScore > threshold) {
      return "Possible Scam";
    }
    return "Normal";
  }
  ```
üëõ Wallet Behavior Monitoring: Monitors wallet activities, flags suspicious transactions and addresses. Tracks wallet connections and analyses transaction frequency. AI predicts the risk of a wallet being involved in fraudulent activities based on historical data.


  ```javascript
function analyzeWalletBehavior(walletTransactions) {
  const transactionFrequency = calculateTransactionFrequency(walletTransactions);
  const riskScore = evaluateWalletRisk(transactionFrequency);
  return riskScore > 50 ? "High Risk Wallet" : "Low Risk Wallet";
}
  ```
üó∫Ô∏è Risk Map: Interactive map showing high-risk areas based on wallet connections and behaviors.

Smart Logic + AI:
Generates visual risk heatmaps by scoring wallet connections, displaying areas with high activity or frequent suspicious transactions.

  ```javascript
function generateRiskMap(walletData) {
  const riskHeatMap = walletData.map(wallet => {
    const riskScore = evaluateWalletRisk(wallet.transactions);
    return { walletAddress: wallet.address, risk: riskScore };
  });
  return riskHeatMap;
}
  ```
ü§ñ AI-Powered Insights: Utilizes AI to predict potential market risks and threats from blockchain data. AI algorithms analyze market trends and wallet behaviors, providing predictions for possible future risks.


  ```javascript
function predictMarketRisk(blockchainData) {
  const predictionModel = trainRiskPredictionModel(blockchainData);
  return predictionModel.predict();
}
  ```
üîî Real-Time Alerts: Get notified of risky activities and transactions directly from the extension. Analyzes transaction data in real-time and sends notifications when suspicious activities are detected.


  ```javascript
function sendAlertIfRiskDetected(transactionData) {
  const riskLevel = analyzeRisk(transactionData);
  if (riskLevel === "High") {
    notifyUser("High-risk transaction detected!");
  }
}
  ```
